### Project Description
Spotify Genie is a personalized music recommendation system that leverages Spotify's API to generate curated playlists tailored to individual user preferences. By analyzing user listening history, favorite genres, and mood preferences, the application uses a combination of clustering and filtering techniques to suggest songs that match each listener's unique taste. The user can directly save our generated playlists to their personal Spotify accounts to listen on demand.
